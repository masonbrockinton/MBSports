           <div>
            In week two, the Eagles beat the Vikings 34-28, staying undefeated despite injuries and inconsistent play. The defense forced four turnovers, with Josh Sweat making a big impact. DeVonta Smith stretched Minnesota's secondary, and D'Andre Swift had a standout game in his hometown. The Eagles now have a 2-0 record for the season.

            Steelers vs. Browns Recap:</div>
            <div>
            The Steeler's defense comes up clutch late in the game with TJ Watt taking the lead with a scoop and score on a Deshaun Watson fumble. Both offenses looked slow, but this was a defensive battle with key player such as Watt and Myles Garrett being forces on both defensive lines. This is a huge division win for C\coach Mike Tomlin
